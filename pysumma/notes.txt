What I need to do next:
    Talk to Choi about what to do with the FileManager object
        - Should we look at Windows file URLS as well as Linux ones?
    Work on getting a script to generate the fileManager.txt test file
        - Needs to get the correct file paths based on the machine
    Make sure the test_simulation file is finished
